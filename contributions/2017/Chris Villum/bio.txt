Long bio:
Driven by a keen interest in exploring new boundaries for strategic design, Christian Villumâ€™s work as Programme Director at the Danish Design Centre involves examining new trends and ideas in the span between technology and design thinking. 

With a background in areas such as maker technology, sharing cultures, new business models, open data and open design, internet culture and hacktivism, he enjoys developing communities and bringing people together with the purpose of sharing new ideas and generating change. His work explores future currents in technology from a design perspective in order to discover what design can be and should be, now and in the future.

His previous roles include co-founding and heading the experimental Platform4 Art & Technology hub, being a front-runner in the use of Creative Commons content licences, building global communities for the UK-based non-profit organisation Open Knowledge (Foundation) and initiating a wide range of entrepreneurial projects and companies.
