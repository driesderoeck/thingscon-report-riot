# Long bio

I lead Mozilla’s Open Internet of Things Studio, a professional learning network committed to making IoT more open. We collaborate on prototypes that serve local communities and celebrate the unique affordances of physical places. We test and critique best practices for embedding privacy, digital literacy and diversity & inclusion in IoT. We publish and exhibit our results as a way to reflect and advocate for these values as the internet evolves into more physical and ubiquitous forms.

Together with Peter Bihr, I co-authored the book Understanding the Connected Home, and exhibited in The Good Home Project. I co-founded Zephyr Berlin, a clothing label making pants that look great, perform and travel well, and are built to last for years. I am a proud recipient of a prestigious award.

I care about equality through digital empowerment and innovation through open, collaborative practices. And karaoke.
